# PokerFHE

**PokerFHE** is a fully on-chain, privacy-preserving Texas Hold‚Äôem poker game that uses **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to ensure that players‚Äô hands and the shared card pool remain partially encrypted while still allowing fair game resolution.  
It enables secure, trustless gameplay without exposing sensitive game state to any participant or server.

---

## Project Background

Traditional online poker requires either:

- **Trusted third parties:** Game servers know players‚Äô cards, creating a potential vector for cheating.  
- **Complex cryptographic protocols:** Often too slow for real-time gameplay.

PokerFHE addresses these challenges by:

- Encrypting all private hands using FHE.  
- Computing hand rankings and determining winners directly on ciphertext.  
- Preventing cheating while preserving the core game experience.  
- Eliminating the need to trust a centralized server.

## Core Concepts

### üîí Encrypted Player Hands
- Each player's cards are encrypted before being sent on-chain.  
- Encrypted cards are never revealed until the game ends.  
- FHE allows computation on encrypted hands for hand comparison.

### üÉè Secure Community Card Pool
- Shared cards are partially encrypted to maintain secrecy.  
- Computation of combinations (flop, turn, river) happens homomorphically.  
- Ensures fair determination of winning hands without leaking intermediate states.

### üé≤ On-Chain Game Logic
- Game rules and card comparisons are executed directly on-chain using FHE computation.  
- No participant can manipulate outcomes or view other players‚Äô hands.  
- Ensures fully trustless gameplay and transparent results.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables:

1. **Computation on encrypted hands:** Compare and rank cards without decryption.  
2. **Cheat-proof gameplay:** No party can alter cards or game logic undetectably.  
3. **Privacy-preserving strategy:** Players‚Äô tactics and card knowledge remain confidential.  
4. **Decentralized trust:** Game resolution is verifiable on-chain, reducing reliance on centralized servers.

FHE makes it possible to play **secure, fair, and private poker directly on a blockchain**.

## Architecture

### 1. Encrypted Hand Submission
- Players encrypt their hole cards locally using FHE.  
- Encrypted hands are submitted to smart contracts on-chain.

### 2. Homomorphic Game Engine
- Determines hand strength and resolves winners using FHE computations.  
- Processes community cards and player hands without exposing raw card values.  
- Supports multiple simultaneous tables without revealing sensitive game state.

### 3. Frontend Interaction
- Players interact with a web or mobile interface.  
- Encrypted hands and real-time game state updates are transmitted securely.  
- User interface displays public game info while preserving private hand confidentiality.

## Gameplay Workflow

1. **Player Registration**
   - Each player generates FHE keys locally.  
   - Hole cards are encrypted before submission.

2. **Card Dealing**
   - Smart contracts manage deck shuffling using verifiable cryptographic protocols.  
   - Cards are encrypted and dealt to players homomorphically.

3. **Betting Rounds**
   - All actions (bet, raise, fold) are recorded on-chain.  
   - Decisions do not reveal players‚Äô hands or strategies.

4. **Hand Comparison**
   - At showdown, FHE computation evaluates hand rankings.  
   - Winner is determined without revealing any intermediate hand information.

5. **Payout**
   - Winnings are distributed according to homomorphic outcome computation.  
   - Game outcome is verifiable, fully trustless, and privacy-preserving.
